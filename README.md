# Resourse-constrained-semantic-segmentation
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive approach to semantic segmentation for waste sorting, specifically designed to operate efficiently under limited computational resources. The goal is to enable accurate, real-time waste sorting using lightweight deep learning models that can be deployed on edge devices or in environments with constrained hardware.

Features
Lightweight Semantic Segmentation Models:
Implements and compares three efficient neural network architectures:

ICNet: Utilizes a cascade of multi-resolution inputs and feature fusion for high-quality, fast segmentation.

BiSeNet: Employs separate spatial and context paths to balance spatial detail and global context, using attention refinement modules.

ENet: Focuses on an efficient encoder-decoder design with bottleneck modules, factorized convolutions, and regularization for real-time performance.

Model Compression & Optimization:
Applies techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to further reduce model size and computational requirements without significant loss in accuracy.

Binary & Instance Segmentation:
Supports both binary segmentation (foreground/background) for basic waste detection and instance segmentation for distinguishing and classifying individual waste items.

Transfer and Few-Shot Learning:
Incorporates transfer learning and few-shot learning strategies to maximize performance with limited annotated data, reducing labeling effort and accelerating deployment.

Hardware & Edge Deployment:
Optimized for deployment on edge devices using hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs), enabling real-time sorting in practical waste management scenarios.

Results
Performance Metrics:

Achieved high segmentation accuracy (Mean IoU) across multiple waste categories (paper, bottle, aluminum, nylon).

ICNet demonstrated the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, outperforming BiSeNet and ENet in most tests.

Resource Usage:

All models were designed to fit within strict memory and computational constraints (e.g., under 10MB for edge applications).

Quantization and pruning further reduced model size with minimal accuracy loss.

Applications
Automated Waste Sorting:
Enables real-time identification and sorting of recyclable materials in waste management facilities.

Sustainable Waste Management:
Reduces landfill use by improving the efficiency and accuracy of recycling processes.
